# Revolutionary UI CLI System

## 🏭 Overview

The Revolutionary UI now includes a comprehensive CLI system that automatically analyzes projects, provides AI-powered recommendations, and sets up optimal development environments. When installed as an npm package, it runs automatically to configure projects with 60-95% less code.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Post-Install Setup**
When installed via npm (`npm install @vladimirdukelic/revolutionary-ui`), the system automatically:
- Analyzes the project structure
- Runs AI-powered analysis for personalized recommendations
- Installs recommended packages based on the tech stack
- Configures development tools (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier)
- Creates configuration files
- Provides tailored next steps

### 2. **AI-Powered Intelligence**
The AI Analyzer (`src/lib/factory/ai-analyzer.ts`) provides:
- **Project Insights**: Deep analysis of architecture patterns and potential issues
- **Smart Recommendations**: Prioritized suggestions with impact estimates
- **Architecture Advice**: Framework-specific best practices
- **Performance Optimizations**: Bundle size, caching, and rendering improvements
- **Security Considerations**: Authentication, validation, and dependency management

### 3. **Comprehensive Package Support**
- **11 JavaScript Frameworks**: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, SolidJS, Qwik, Preact, Lit, Alpine.js, Ember
- **14 UI Libraries**: Material-UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, Mantine, Tailwind CSS, and more
- **15 Icon Libraries**: 75,000+ icons from Lucide, Heroicons, Font Awesome, etc.
- **Design Tools**: Figma/Sketch importers, color manipulation tools
- **8 Professional Fonts**: Inter, Roboto, Poppins, and more

## 📦 Installation & Usage

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components Location

All CLI components are now in the main project under `src/lib/factory/`:

1. **Project Detector** (`project-detector.ts`)
   - Analyzes package.json and project structure
   - Detects 100+ packages across all categories
   - Identifies missing features and outdated packages

2. **Project Analyzer** (`project-analyzer.ts`)
   - Generates compatibility reports
   - Creates setup plans with time estimates
   - Provides optimization suggestions

3. **AI Analyzer** (`ai-analyzer.ts`)
   - Analyzes project context for insights
   - Generates intelligent recommendations
   - Provides architecture and security advice

4. **Setup Wizard** (`setup-wizard.ts`)
   - Interactive and automatic modes
   - Package selection by category
   - Configuration file generation

5. **Package Installer** (`package-installer.ts`)
   - Handles package installation
   - Creates configuration files
   - Updates package.json scripts

6. **Post-Install Script** (`postinstall.ts`)
   - Runs automatically after npm install
   - Skips in CI environments
   - Creates .revolutionary-ui-setup marker

7. **CLI Interface** (`cli.ts`)
   - Main command-line interface
   - Integrates all components
   - Beautiful formatted output

### Configuration Files

All package configurations are in `src/config/`:
- `frameworks.ts` - JavaScript framework definitions
- `ui-libraries.ts` - UI component library catalog
- `icon-libraries.ts` - Icon library registry
- `design-tools.ts` - Design tool integrations
- `factory-resources.ts` - Master configuration

## 🔧 Build System

The project uses a custom build system (`build-cli.js`) that:
1. Resolves TypeScript path aliases
2. Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
3. Creates distribution package
4. Prepares for npm publication

Build commands:
```bash
npm run build        # Build everything
npm run build:lib    # Build library only
npm run build:cli    # Build CLI only
```

## 📊 Example AI Recommendation

```javascript
{
  category: 'State Management',
  recommendation: 'Add Zustand for state management',
  reasoning: 'Your React app has grown complex enough to benefit from centralized state management.',
  priority: 'high',
  packages: ['zustand'],
  estimatedImpact: '40% reduction in prop drilling, 60% faster feature development'
}
```

## 🎯 Usage Example

```bash
$ npm install @vladimirdukelic/revolutionary-ui
