## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** 18.0 or higher
- **npm** 8.0 or higher (or yarn/pnpm)
- A project using one of our supported frameworks:
  - React 19.0+

  - Angular 19.0+
  - Svelte 5.0+
  - Or any other modern framework

## 🚀 Quick Installation

```bash
npm install @vladimirdukelic/revolutionary-ui-factory
```

That's it! When you install the package, our intelligent setup system will:

1. **Analyze** your project structure
2. **Detect** your framework and dependencies
3. **Run AI analysis** for personalized recommendations
4. **Install** recommended packages automatically
5. **Configure** your development environment
6. **Provide** next steps tailored to your project

## 🤖 What Happens During Installation

### 1. Project Analysis
The system scans your project to understand:
- Which framework(s) you're using
- Your current UI libraries
- Development tools (TypeScript, ESLint, etc.)
- Project structure and patterns

### 2. AI-Powered Recommendations
Our AI analyzer provides:
- Architecture suggestions
- Performance optimizations
- Missing package recommendations
- Security considerations
- Best practices for your stack

### 3. Automatic Configuration
Based on the analysis, we:
- Install complementary packages
- Create configuration files
- Set up development scripts
- Generate example components

## 🎨 Your First Component

After installation, you can immediately start creating components:

```typescript
import { setup } from '@vladimirdukelic/revolutionary-ui-factory';

// Auto-detects your framework and style system
const ui = setup();

// Create a data table with 95% less code!
const MyTable = ui.DataTable({
  data: users,
  columns: ['name', 'email', 'role', 'status'],
  features: ['sort', 'filter', 'pagination']
});
```

## 📁 Project Structure After Setup

```
your-project/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── examples/        # Generated example components

├── .revolutionary-ui-setup     # Setup marker file
└── package.json               # Updated with new scripts
```

```bash
# Run interactive setup wizard
revolutionary-ui setup

# Analyze without making changes
revolutionary-ui analyze --dry-run

# Skip AI analysis
revolutionary-ui setup --no-ai

# Use specific package manager
