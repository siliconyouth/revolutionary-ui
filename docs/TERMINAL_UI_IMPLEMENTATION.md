   - Key metrics display
   - Framework usage statistics
   - Code reduction trends
   - Factory pattern usage analysis
   - Recent activity timeline

7. **Semantic Search View** (`/src/cli/ui/views/search-view.tsx`)

## Technical Architecture

### File Structure
```
src/cli/ui/
├── terminal-ui.ts          # Core blessed UI system (unused in favor of React)
├── terminal-ui-app.tsx     # Main React Terminal UI application
├── react-terminal-ui.tsx   # React components library (unused)
├── comprehensive-terminal-ui.tsx  # Full implementation (reference)
└── views/
    ├── catalog-view.tsx    # Catalog browser component
    ├── settings-view.tsx   # Settings manager component
    ├── analytics-view.tsx  # Analytics dashboard component
    └── search-view.tsx     # Semantic search component
```

### Key Components

1. **TerminalUIApp** - Main application component that manages:
   - State management for views and navigation
   - Service initialization (Database, Resource services)
   - Keyboard event handling
   - View rendering logic

2. **View Components** - Each view is a self-contained React component with:
   - Props interface for dependencies
   - Local state management
   - Event handlers
   - Blessed widget composition

### Integration Points

1. **CLI Integration**
   - Terminal UI is now the default for `ai-interactive` command
   - Removed fallback to standard mode
   - Direct integration with existing services

2. **Service Integration**
   - DatabaseResourceService (singleton pattern)
   - EnhancedResourceService (singleton pattern)
   - AIService (optional, passed from CLI)

## Usage

### Starting Terminal UI
```bash
# Primary method (Terminal UI is default)
npx revolutionary-ui ai-interactive

# Alternative aliases
npx revolutionary-ui ai-wizard
```

### Navigation
- **↑/↓**: Navigate menu items
- **Enter**: Select item
- **ESC**: Go back / Exit
- **Tab**: Switch focus between panels
- **←/→**: Switch tabs (in tabbed views)

## Technical Decisions

1. **React-Blessed over Pure Blessed**
   - Better component composition
   - Familiar React patterns
   - Easier state management
   - JSX syntax for UI structure

2. **Singleton Services**
   - Prevents multiple database connections
   - Consistent state across views
   - Better resource management

3. **View-Based Architecture**
   - Each major feature is a separate view
   - Easy to add new features
   - Consistent navigation pattern
   - Isolated component logic

## Future Enhancements

1. **Interactive Features**
   - Editable settings with form inputs
   - Component code preview in catalog
   - Real-time generation preview
   - Team collaboration features

2. **Performance**
   - Lazy loading of views
   - Pagination for large lists
   - Caching of catalog data
   - Background data fetching

3. **User Experience**
   - Customizable color themes
   - Keyboard shortcut customization
   - Mouse support enhancement
   - Context-sensitive help

## Known Issues

1. **Terminal Warnings**
   - "Error on xterm-256color.Setulc" - Harmless terminal capability warning
   - Can be suppressed with `2>/dev/null`

2. **Build Warnings**
   - TypeScript JSX configuration warnings
   - Service constructor access patterns
   - These don't affect runtime functionality

## Testing

The Terminal UI can be tested with:
```bash
# Run directly
npm run ai-interactive

# Run with debugging
DEBUG=revolutionary-ui:* npm run ai-interactive

# Run without terminal warnings
npm run ai-interactive 2>/dev/null
```

## Conclusion

The Terminal UI implementation provides a comprehensive, user-friendly interface for all Revolutionary UI features. It successfully replaces the need for memorizing CLI commands while maintaining the power and flexibility of the command-line environment.
