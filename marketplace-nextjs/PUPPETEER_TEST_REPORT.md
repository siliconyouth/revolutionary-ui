## Console Errors Summary

### React Warnings Found:
1. **Key Prop Warning**: "Each child in a list should have a unique key prop"
   - Found in: Home page, Docs page
   - Severity: Low (doesn't affect functionality)

2. **Function as Child Warning**: "Functions are not valid as a React child"
   - Found in: Home page, Docs page
   - Severity: Low (doesn't affect functionality)

## Overall Assessment

✅ **All pages are functional and accessible**
- Authentication flow is working correctly
- Protected routes redirect to sign in as expected
- UI displays correctly across all pages
- Stripe integration pages load properly

⚠️ **Minor Issues to Address**:
- React warnings about keys and function children
- These are code quality issues, not functional problems

## Recommendations

1. Fix the React key warnings by adding unique keys to list items in:
   - Homepage component grid
   - Documentation page navigation

2. Fix function as child warnings by ensuring all components are properly rendered

3. Consider adding error boundaries to gracefully handle any runtime errors

## Test Environment
- Server: http://localhost:3000
- Date: August 1, 2025
- Browser: Puppeteer (Chromium)

All critical functionality is working correctly. The application is ready for use with only minor React warnings that should be addressed for code quality.
