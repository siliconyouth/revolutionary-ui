### 3. Monetization
- Premium components with Stripe integration
- Creator earnings and payout tracking
- Platform fee management

### 4. Enterprise Features
- Team collaboration with role-based access

## Database Indexes

Strategic indexes for optimal performance:
- User lookups: email, role
- Resource queries: slug, category, author, published status
- Analytics: timestamps, event types
- Search: tags, frameworks, names

## Security Considerations

1. **Row-Level Security**: Implemented via Supabase RLS
2. **Encrypted Fields**: API keys, tokens
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete activity logging
4. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions

## Sample Queries

### Find Featured Components
```sql
SELECT r.*, array_agg(t.name) as tags
FROM resources r
LEFT JOIN _ResourceTags rt ON r.id = rt.A
LEFT JOIN tags t ON rt.B = t.id
WHERE r.is_featured = true 
  AND r.is_published = true
GROUP BY r.id
ORDER BY r.published_at DESC;
```

### Team Component Usage
```sql
SELECT 
  t.name as team_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT tr.resource_id) as shared_components,
  COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) as projects
FROM teams t
LEFT JOIN team_resources tr ON t.id = tr.team_id
LEFT JOIN projects p ON t.id = p.team_id
GROUP BY t.id;
```

### AI Usage by Provider
```sql
SELECT 
  ap.name as provider,
  am.display_name as model,
  SUM(au.total_tokens) as total_tokens,
  SUM(au.estimated_cost) as total_cost
FROM ai_usage au
JOIN ai_providers ap ON au.provider_id = ap.id
JOIN ai_models am ON au.model_id = am.id
GROUP BY ap.id, am.id
ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
```

## Migration Strategy

1. **Initial Setup**: `prisma db push` for development
2. **Production**: Use migrations with `prisma migrate`
3. **Seeding**: Comprehensive seed script with sample data
4. **Backups**: Regular Supabase backups

## Future Enhancements

1. **Full-Text Search**: PostgreSQL FTS for components
2. **Time-Series Data**: Separate analytics database
3. **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed data
4. **GraphQL API**: Prisma + GraphQL integration
